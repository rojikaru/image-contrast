# Native System APIs Monorepo

A monorepository for my projects that utilize native system APIs. 
It focuses on being cross-platform and aims to provide a consistent interface for accessing system-level functionalities across different operating systems. 

## Projects
- [Git Fetcher](git-fetcher): A tool to fetch and manage Git repositories.
- [Image Contrast Library](image-contrast): A library for adjusting image contrast using native APIs.
- [Image Contrast Staticly-Linked Client](image-contrast-client): A statically linked client for the Image Contrast library.
- [Image Contrast Dynamically-Linked Client](image-contrast-dynamic-client): A dynamically linked client for the Image Contrast library.
